# WebCvApp (WebMFS)
This application is to present your personal CV. But it is even more, it shows how a small service orientated application (SOA) can be organized and gives you a small insight into my technical skills.

For more details of the concept behind and how the application is organized, please look at the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/rebel-l/WebCvApp/wiki).

For my job-related profiles you can have a look at [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Lars_Gaubisch), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lars-gaubisch-a6b1a423) or [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de/members/171666842/).
